# Seamless View Theme for Obsidian

**Seamless View** is a custom theme for Obsidian that aims to provide a **unified and seamless reading experience** by minimizing the visual differences between the live preview mode and the reading mode.

## Features

- **Seamless Transition**: With Seamless View, you'll hardly notice the difference between reading mode and live preview mode. This allows for an uninterrupted flow of thoughts as you write and review your notes.
- **Customization:** While the core design promotes a seamless experience, you can still personalize various aspects of the theme to suit your preferences.

## Installation

1. Open Obsidian and go to **Settings > Appearance**.
2. Click on the **Themes** tab.
3. Click on the **Community Themes** button.
4. Search for **Seamless View** and click on the **Install** button.
5. Click on the **Use** button to activate the theme.

## Usage

Once installed, simply switch between reading mode and live preview mode to appreciate the seamless transition between the two. Customize the theme further according to your preferences by tweaking the CSS variables in the `seamless-view.css` file.
